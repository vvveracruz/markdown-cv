# Markdown CV

An easy way to create a simple CV in markdown.

## How to
- Clone the repo or download `.zip` file.
- Edit `index.html`.
- From the terminal, navigate to the folder and run `jekyll serve`.
- Open the browser and navigate to `localhost:4000`.
- There's your CV ðŸŽ‰
- You can download a PDF copy by printing the page. In Chrome: `File > Print..`.

## Example

![Ada Lovelace's CV](/assets/ada.jpg)

## Changing the formatting
This CV relies (mostly) on standard bootstrap stylesheets in `\assets\css`. You can override the bootstrap settings by adding your own settings to `\assets\css\custom.scss`. I wouldn't recommend editing any of the bootrstap files directly.
